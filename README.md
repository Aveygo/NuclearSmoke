<br/>

As a NSW resident, the government really likes to leave us in the dust on bushfire data by preventing the public from accessing critical forecasts and withholding it for commercial use only -> ["Find out how we can support the prosperity and safety of your business in Australia."](http://reg.bom.gov.au/reguser/) which is also under strict licencing agreements ðŸ¤—.

The only place we can have any clue about what is on fire at the moment, is from the NSW Rural Fire Service [(RFS)](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me), who seem to be the only good guys in this story.

This is where Nuclear Smoke comes it. This is a project attempting to use the very little data provided to estimate smoke fallout in NSW.

I hope for my tool to be use as freely as possibly, as long as it stays free. If this project helped you in any way, you can [donate to the RFS](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/volunteer/support-your-local-brigade), or give the repository a star.
