# Nuclear Smoke

[Nuclear Smoke](https://aveygo.github.io/NuclearSmoke/)

Predicting smoke "fallout" using WSEG10, an model designed by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group for the United States Army in 1980.

Currently, I am only predicting for fires in NSW, but the logic can extend to any fire with known location, size and wind speed/direction/shear.

## TODO
 - Documentation
 - Gain some read world observations
